# Gloss — LEVEL 1 (Lexical Meaning)

Gloss atoms define the **primary lexical sense** of Sanskrit terms
as they appear in scripture.

They do not interpret doctrine.
They do not assert philosophy.
They do not generalize beyond usage.

Rules:
- One term per file
- Grounded in scripture usage
- No abstraction or application
- No dependence on higher layers

Gloss exists to stabilize meaning before interpretation.
