# Translations — LEVEL 3 (Language Rendering)

Translations render canonical text
into a target language.

They do not explain.
They do not harmonize.
They do not correct scripture.

Rules:
- One translation per file
- Translator identity must be explicit
- Faithful rendering over paraphrase
- No commentary embedded

Translation is representation, not interpretation.
