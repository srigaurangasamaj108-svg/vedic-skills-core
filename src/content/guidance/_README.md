# Guidance — LEVEL 6 (Contextual Application)

Guidance atoms offer **situational reflection**
for human contexts.

They are optional.
They are non-authoritative.
They are explicitly bounded.

Rules:
- Context must be stated
- Must disclaim authority
- Must reference lower layers
- No universal prescriptions

Guidance supports reflection — not obedience.
