# Sampradāya — Interpretive Traditions

Sampradāya content represents
**living traditions of interpretation and practice**.

It is not scripture.
It does not add authority.
It interprets existing authority.

Rules:
- Must reference canon
- Must declare tradition clearly
- Must not override scripture
- Must remain downstream of authority

Sampradāya is a lens — not a source.
