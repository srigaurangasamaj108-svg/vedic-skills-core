# Principles — LEVEL 4 (Declarative Truths)

Principle atoms state **clear, minimal truths**
derived from scripture and commentary.

They are not exhaustive.
They are not situational.
They are not advice.

Rules:
- One declarative sentence
- Explicit scriptural grounding
- No emotional or rhetorical language
- No application guidance

Principles say what is — not what to do.
