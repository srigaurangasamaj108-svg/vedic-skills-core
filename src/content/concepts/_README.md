# Concepts — LEVEL 1 (Semantic Patterns)

Concept atoms describe **recurring semantic structures**
that emerge from scripture and glosses.

They are not doctrines.
They are not conclusions.
They are not prescriptions.

Rules:
- Derived from multiple canonical instances
- Explicit references required
- No guidance or application
- No sampradāya assumptions

Concepts reveal patterns — they do not teach practice.
