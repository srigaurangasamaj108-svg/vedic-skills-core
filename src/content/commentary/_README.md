# Commentary — LEVEL 3 (Interpretive Explanation)

Commentary atoms explain scripture
from a declared perspective.

They may interpret.
They may argue.
They may emphasize.

Rules:
- Perspective must be explicit
- Must reference canon directly
- No authority over scripture
- No guidance or prescription

Commentary explains meaning — it does not replace it.
