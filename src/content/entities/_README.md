# Entities — LEVEL 2 (Persons, Places, Events)

Entity atoms represent **contextual facts**:
people, locations, events, and circumstances
that appear in scripture or history.

Rules:
- Descriptive only
- No interpretation or evaluation
- May support higher layers
- Must not introduce doctrine

Entities provide context, not meaning.
