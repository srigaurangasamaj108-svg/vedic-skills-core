# Vedic Skills — Project Constitution

This document defines the **non-negotiable constitutional laws**
governing the Vedic Skills platform.

All architecture, content, automation, UI, and governance
must comply with this constitution.

No implementation convenience overrides these principles.

---

## 1. Core Purpose

Vedic Skills is a **doctrine-preserving knowledge system**
designed to:

• Preserve śāstra verbatim  
• Separate authority from interpretation  
• Enable applied understanding without distortion  
• Prevent accidental doctrinal drift  
• Scale safely through automation  

The system must be **structurally incapable of lying**.

---

## 2. Authority Model (LOCKED)

The platform operates on a **7-level authority stack**:

LEVEL 0 — Canon (CKA)LEVEL 1 — Gloss / ConceptLEVEL 2 — Entity / CircumstanceLEVEL 3 — Translation / CommentaryLEVEL 4 — PrincipleLEVEL 5 — SkillLEVEL 6 — Guidance
### Authority Rules

• Each level depends only on lower levels  
• No level may override or rewrite a lower level  
• Higher levels are removable without collapsing lower levels  
• Canon is immutable  

---

## 3. Canon Doctrine (VKAD-01)

### 3.1 Canon Definition

A **Canonical Knowledge Atom (CKA)** is:

• One verse or smallest canonical unit  
• Stored verbatim  
• Immutable  
• Sequential  
• Context-aware  

### 3.2 Canon Immutability

Canon:

• Cannot be edited silently  
• Cannot contain commentary, translation, or UI hints  
• Cannot import components  
• Cannot contain JSX  
• Cannot be generated by automation  

Canon is **preserved**, not authored.

---

## 4. Scriptural Hierarchy (ORTHOGONAL AXIS)

Canonical sources follow this hierarchy:

śruti (rank 1)smṛti (rank 2)itihāsa (rank 3)purāṇa (rank 4)āgama (rank 5)
Hierarchy applies **only to Canon (LEVEL 0)**.

Derived layers may **read** hierarchy via references,
but may **never define or override it**.

---

## 5. Atomization Law

Everything is an **Atom**.

• One file = one atomic unit  
• No file mixes authority layers  
• Relationships are explicit and referential  
• Duplication is forbidden  

---

## 6. Automation Doctrine

Automation is a **gatekeeper**, not an author.

Automation MAY:
• validate structure
• scaffold files
• enforce doctrine
• detect violations

Automation MAY NOT:
• invent doctrine
• harmonize scripture
• generate guidance
• personalize advice
• act as guru or authority

---

## 7. Guidance Safety Law

Guidance must be:

• Contextual  
• Situational  
• Non-prescriptive  
• Non-diagnostic  
• Reversible  

Guidance must NEVER:
• replace discernment
• replace mentorship
• replace therapy
• claim universality

---

## 8. Governance & Succession

Future maintainers are **custodians**, not interpreters.

Governance decisions must be:
• mechanical
• traceable
• reversible
• doctrine-aligned

No individual or AI may acquire doctrinal authority.

---

## 9. Change Protocol

Any change affecting:
• Canon
• Authority boundaries
• Hierarchy
• Automation permissions

Requires:
• explicit declaration
• documented rationale
• versioned approval

Silence ≠ consent.

---

## 10. Constitutional Priority

If any implementation conflicts with this document:

👉 **This document prevails.**
