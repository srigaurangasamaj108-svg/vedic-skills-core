The Constitutional Law of Vedic Skills
Status: Binding & Non-NegotiableApplies to: All code, content, automation, UI, and future phasesLast ratified: Phase 10 (Reader & Layered Rendering)

0. Purpose of This Document
This document defines the constitutional law of the Vedic Skills project.
It answers one question only:
What is this system allowed to be?
Everything else—schemas, scripts, UI, folders, automation—exists only to obey this document.
If there is any conflict between:
	•	chat instructions
	•	developer intent
	•	convenience
	•	tooling defaults
	•	implementation shortcuts
👉 This Constitution prevails.

1. Foundational Principle
Vedic Skills is a śāstra-faithful knowledge system.
It exists to preserve, transmit, and layer Vedic knowledge without distortion, modernization bias, or authority collapse.
The system must never replace śāstra with opinion, nor collapse multiple epistemic levels into one.

2. Absolute Authority Stack (Frozen)
Authority flows strictly downward and never upward.
2.1 Canonical Authority (LEVEL 0)
These are sources of revelation or authoritative derivation.
	1	Śruti — primary, apauruṣeya revelation
	2	Smṛti — remembered tradition derived from Śruti
	◦	including Itihāsa and Purāṇa
	3	Āgama — ritual and worship systems aligned with Śruti–Smṛti
	4	Vedāṅga — auxiliary limbs preserving Śruti
	5	Upaveda — applied sacred knowledge derived from Veda
	6	Ṣaḍ-darśana — philosophical systems interpreting Śruti
These together form LEVEL 0: Canon.
They are:
	•	immutable
	•	non-interpretive
	•	non-modernized
	•	non-negotiable

3. Derived Epistemic Layers (Non-Canonical)
Everything below LEVEL 0 is derived, interpretive, or applied.

Sampradāya
Interpretive tradition
Authority never flows upward.

4. Sampradāya (Special Rule)
Sampradāya is not canon.
Sampradāyas:
	•	interpret canon
	•	live canon
	•	practice canon
They do not create canon.
Therefore:
	•	Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism exists in sampradaya/
	•	never in scripture/
	•	never as a source of authority
	•	always as a lens, not a root

5. Canon Integrity Rules (Non-Negotiable)
5.1 Canon Files
Canonical files must:
	•	represent one atomic unit (verse, sūtra, mantra, etc.)
	•	be language-faithful
	•	be immutable
	•	contain no interpretation
	•	contain no commentary
	•	contain no translation mixing
5.2 Canon Is Not Flattened
There is:
	•	no single linear hierarchy
	•	no ranking by importance
	•	no modern taxonomy
Canon is a dependency graph, not a ladder.

6. Separation of Concerns (Strict)
The following must never be mixed:
	•	scripture vs commentary
	•	translation vs interpretation
	•	canon vs sampradāya
	•	knowledge vs pedagogy
	•	authority vs application
Each layer exists only in its own domain.

7. Automation Doctrine
Automation is clerical, not authorial.
Scripts may:
	•	scaffold files
	•	enforce structure
	•	validate dependencies
Scripts may never:
	•	infer meaning
	•	generate doctrine
	•	harmonize śāstra
	•	collapse layers

8. UI Doctrine
The UI is a reader, not a teacher.
UI must:
	•	render what exists
	•	respect authority order
	•	show layered disclosure
	•	never synthesize content
UI must never decide truth.

9. Change Control (Constitutional)
The following require constitutional amendment:
	•	changing authority levels
	•	merging layers
	•	altering canon scope
	•	weakening schema guarantees
	•	allowing automation to author content
If a change affects meaning, it is constitutional, not mechanical.

10. What This Project Is Not
Vedic Skills is not:
	•	a blog
	•	a wiki
	•	a philosophy site
	•	a religious opinion platform
	•	a modernized reinterpretation
	•	a comparative religion engine

11. Guiding Maxim
Śruti is the root.Smṛti is the body.Purāṇa is the heart.Vedānta is the intellect.Bhakti is the life-force.
The system exists to protect this order, not explain it away.

12. Final Clause (Very Important)
Once frozen:
	•	Canon does not change
	•	Schemas do not drift
	•	Authority does not blur
Only new content, correctly layered, may be added.

This Constitution is binding.All future work proceeds within it or not at all.
