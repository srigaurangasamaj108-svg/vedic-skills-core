# VKAD-13 — Mentoring, Guidance & Safety UX Doctrine  
*“Guidance must protect the seeker before it instructs.”*

---

## 0. Status & Scope

**Doctrine Level:** Constitutional  
**Applies To:** Guidance, mentoring, counseling, life-stage overlays, community help  
**Overrides:** Coaching UX, self-help frameworks, prescriptive advice models

VKAD-13 governs **how guidance is presented, framed, and constrained**.

It exists to prevent:
• psychological harm  
• misapplied scripture  
• authority abuse  
• one-size-fits-all counsel  
• role confusion (teacher vs healer vs elder)

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **The system may illuminate paths,  
but it must never walk the path for the user.**

Vedic Skills does not:
• diagnose  
• prescribe  
• command  
• replace professional care  

Guidance is **reflective**, not directive.

---

## 2. The Guidance Boundary Law (Non-Negotiable)

All guidance content must obey these boundaries:

### 2.1 Allowed
- Framing questions
- Reflective prompts
- Scriptural perspectives
- Value clarification
- Ethical lenses

### 2.2 Forbidden
❌ Medical advice  
❌ Psychological diagnosis  
❌ Legal counsel  
❌ Absolute instructions  
❌ “You must / should / always” language  
❌ Claims of guaranteed outcomes  

Violation = immediate removal.

---

## 3. Life-Stage Context Locking

All guidance must be **explicitly contextualized**.

Guidance content **must declare**:
- Intended life-stage(s)
- Intended role (student, householder, elder, couple, parent)
- Excluded audiences (if any)

Example:
> “This reflection applies to householders navigating responsibility,  
not to renunciates or crisis situations.”

If context is missing, guidance must not render.

---

## 4. Safety-First UX Presentation

Guidance UI must visually and structurally differ from scripture.

### Mandatory UX signals:
- Softer typography
- Reduced contrast
- Clear disclaimers
- Slower pacing
- No authority styling

Guidance must **feel different** from canon.

---

## 5. Crisis & Vulnerability Guardrails

Certain topics trigger **Safety Mode** automatically.

Triggers include:
- grief
- abuse
- self-harm
- trauma
- extreme distress

### Safety Mode Effects:
- Guidance narrows (less content)
- Disclaimers surface prominently
- External help references may appear
- No community replies allowed
- No scripture re-interpretation

The system must **slow down**, not expand.

---

## 6. Mentoring Role Separation

The system recognizes **distinct mentoring roles**:

- Scriptural mentor (śāstra clarity)
- Life elder (experience framing)
- Peer guide (shared journey)

A single UI surface must **never blur roles**.

Users must know:
> “Who is speaking, and from what authority?”

---

## 7. No Private Dependency Loops

Mentoring UX must prevent dependency.

Forbidden patterns:
❌ 1:1 exclusive guidance without escalation  
❌ Continuous private threads  
❌ Emotional reliance cues  
❌ “Only I understand you” framing  

Encouraged patterns:
• time-bounded guidance  
• reflection windows  
• encouragement of external support  
• self-agency reinforcement  

---

## 8. Scripture Usage in Guidance

Scripture in guidance must obey:

- Quotation, not reinterpretation
- Context preserved
- Multiple perspectives allowed
- No verse used as command

Scripture illuminates **principles**, not instructions.

---

## 9. Disclosure & Consent Doctrine

Before accessing mentoring or guidance:

Users must be shown:
- What guidance is
- What it is not
- Its limitations
- Their agency

Consent must be **explicit**, not implied.

---

## 10. Community Interaction Limits

Guidance-related community interaction must be:
- Moderated
- Non-reactive (no likes)
- Non-competitive
- Respectfully slow

Guidance discussions are **not debates**.

---

## 11. Escalation & Exit Paths

Guidance must always offer:
- exit
- pause
- redirection
- external help

A user must never feel “trapped” in guidance content.

---

## 12. Enforcement Mechanisms

VKAD-13 is enforced by:

• guidance-specific layouts  
• content linting (language checks)  
• life-stage validation  
• feature flags  
• human editorial review  

If uncertain, **remove guidance**.

---

## 13. Closing Statement

> **True guidance strengthens agency.  
False guidance creates dependence.**

The system exists to **serve the seeker**,  
not to replace their conscience, community, or care.
