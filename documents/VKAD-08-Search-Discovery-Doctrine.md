# VKAD-08: SEARCH, DISCOVERY & KNOWLEDGE NAVIGATION DOCTRINE  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine governs **how users find knowledge** within the Vedic Skills ecosystem.

It exists to ensure that:

• search does not replace study  
• discovery does not replace reading  
• algorithms do not replace tradition  
• relevance does not override authority  
• convenience does not distort canon  

Search is a *tool*, not a teacher.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Search must reveal structure,  
not manufacture meaning.**

The system may help users *locate* knowledge.  
It must never help users *decide what it means*.

---

## 2. SEARCH IS NOT DISCOVERY (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

### 2.1 Search

Search answers:
> “Where does this exist?”

Search is:
• explicit  
• user-initiated  
• deterministic  

---

### 2.2 Discovery

Discovery answers:
> “What may be related?”

Discovery is:
• secondary  
• optional  
• conservative  

Discovery must **never lead**.

---

## 3. SEARCH DOMAINS (SEPARATION OF CONCERNS)

The platform recognizes **four distinct search domains**.

Search must respect these boundaries.

---

### 3.1 Canonical Search (Primary)

**Scope**
• verses  
• text structure  
• exact references  

**Behavior**
• literal matching  
• verse-first results  
• canonical order  

No ranking by popularity.

---

### 3.2 Conceptual Search (Graph-Based)

**Scope**
• concepts (entities)  
• defined terms  

**Behavior**
• definition-first  
• transparent relationships  
• reverse lookups (“where is this concept mentioned?”)

Concept search never returns *opinions*.

---

### 3.3 Pedagogical Search (Study & Guidance)

**Scope**
• courses  
• guidance content  

**Behavior**
• opt-in  
• clearly labeled  
• downstream of canon  

Pedagogical search must never intercept canonical queries.

---

### 3.4 Reference Search (PDFs & External)

**Scope**
• registered PDFs  
• reference materials  

**Behavior**
• lowest priority  
• explicitly marked as “Reference”  

PDFs never outrank verses.

---

## 4. SEARCH RESULT PRIORITIZATION (FIXED ORDER)

Regardless of query type, results must rank in this order:

1. Canonical verses  
2. Text location hits (chapter, canto, etc.)  
3. Concept entities  
4. Commentaries / purports  
5. Courses & guidance  
6. Community programs  
7. PDFs / reference materials  

No algorithm may override this hierarchy.

---

## 5. FORBIDDEN SEARCH BEHAVIORS

The platform must NEVER implement:

❌ “Trending verses”  
❌ “Most read ślokas”  
❌ “People also searched”  
❌ Popularity-weighted ranking  
❌ Engagement-based ordering  

Śāstra is not a marketplace.

---

## 6. DISCOVERY OVERLAYS (STRICTLY LIMITED)

Discovery is allowed only as **secondary overlays**, such as:

• “Related verses” (structural proximity only)  
• “Related concepts” (entity graph only)  
• “Study paths” (explicitly labeled)  

Discovery must always be:
• dismissible  
• non-intrusive  
• visually quiet  

---

## 7. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ROLE IN SEARCH

The knowledge graph may be used to:

• resolve synonyms  
• connect concepts to verses  
• list relationships  

The graph must NEVER:
❌ infer moral conclusions  
❌ rank interpretations  
❌ prioritize one tradition  

Graph traversal is **transparent**, not intelligent.

---

## 8. LIFE-STAGE & CONTEXTUAL FILTERING

Contextual filters:
• are opt-in  
• are applied after search  
• never alter canonical ordering  

Life-stage filtering must:
• never hide canon  
• never re-rank verses  
• only filter guidance & study layers  

---

## 9. MULTI-LANGUAGE SEARCH ETHICS

Language support must:

• respect original Sanskrit primacy  
• clearly separate translations  
• avoid semantic merging across languages  

Search results must indicate:
• original language  
• translation status  

No auto-translation of search intent.

---

## 10. SEARCH UI PRESENTATION RULES

Search UI must be:

• calm  
• sparse  
• reversible  

Forbidden:
❌ infinite scrolling  
❌ animated result loading  
❌ urgency cues (“Best result”)  

Search is a doorway, not a corridor.

---

## 11. FEATURE FLAGS & GRADUAL EXPOSURE

Advanced search features:
• concept graphs  
• compound queries  
• cross-text analysis  

Must be:
• feature-flagged  
• opt-in  
• role-restricted  

Beginners must never encounter complexity accidentally.

---

## 12. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• algorithmic distortion of canon  
• dopamine-driven browsing  
• popularity bias  
• reduction of scripture to keywords  
• AI-generated meaning paths  

---

## 13. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Search serves the reader.  
Tradition serves the meaning.**

When search begins to *teach*,
the platform has forgotten its role.
