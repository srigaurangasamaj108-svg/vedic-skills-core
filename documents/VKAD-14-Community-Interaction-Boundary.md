# VKAD-14 — Community Interaction & Boundary Doctrine  
*“Community exists to support practice, not to perform identity.”*

---

## 0. Status & Scope

**Doctrine Level:** Constitutional  
**Applies To:** All community features, discussions, events, responses, shared spaces  
**Overrides:** Social network patterns, engagement-driven design, popularity mechanics

VKAD-14 governs:
• how people interact  
• how speech is framed  
• how authority is prevented from emerging socially  
• how safety, dignity, and restraint are preserved  

This doctrine exists to prevent:
• ego amplification  
• factionalism  
• performative spirituality  
• social pressure  
• authority-by-popularity  

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **Community must never become a source of authority.**

Authority flows from:
• scripture
• lived responsibility
• ethical conduct

Never from:
❌ consensus  
❌ charisma  
❌ seniority badges  
❌ engagement metrics  

Community is **supportive**, not interpretive.

---

## 2. Community Purpose Limitation

Community exists **only** for the following purposes:

✔ shared study coordination  
✔ event participation  
✔ service (seva) organization  
✔ moderated discussion  
✔ peer encouragement  

Community does **not** exist for:
❌ doctrinal interpretation  
❌ guidance delivery  
❌ counseling  
❌ debate supremacy  
❌ personal branding  

If an interaction exceeds purpose, it must be redirected or closed.

---

## 3. Visibility & Containment Law

Community content must be **structurally contained**.

Rules:
- Community never appears inside Library reading
- Community never overlays scripture
- Community never interrupts study or guidance
- Community requires deliberate entry

Community is a **room you enter**, not a layer that leaks.

---

## 4. Identity & Representation Doctrine

Community identities must be **modest and functional**.

Allowed:
- first name or chosen name
- role indicators (student, householder, volunteer)
- chapter affiliation

Forbidden:
❌ follower counts  
❌ reputation scores  
❌ titles implying authority  
❌ “expert” badges  
❌ spiritual ranking  

Identity must not become influence.

---

## 5. Speech Constraints (Mandatory)

All community speech must follow these rules:

### Allowed
- respectful questions
- personal experience (clearly framed)
- logistical discussion
- appreciation without elevation

### Forbidden
❌ absolute claims  
❌ universal prescriptions  
❌ scriptural reinterpretation  
❌ moral superiority  
❌ diagnosing others  
❌ “you should / must” language  

Violation requires moderation or removal.

---

## 6. No Engagement Mechanics Doctrine

Community must **not** use engagement amplification.

Explicitly forbidden:
❌ likes  
❌ reactions  
❌ upvotes / downvotes  
❌ trending content  
❌ popularity sorting  
❌ gamification  

Default ordering:
• chronological
• moderated
• calm

Silence is acceptable. Virality is not.

---

## 7. Moderation Philosophy

Moderation is:
• quiet
• consistent
• non-public
• restorative, not punitive

Rules:
- No public shaming
- No visible “strikes”
- No escalation theater
- Clear boundaries, gently enforced

Moderators are **guardians of tone**, not enforcers of opinion.

---

## 8. Guidance Firewall (Critical)

Community **must never replace guidance**.

Rules:
- No advice-giving threads
- No “what should I do” counseling
- No crisis response crowdsourcing
- No personal diagnosis discussions

If guidance is needed:
→ redirect to Guidance layer  
→ pause interaction  
→ offer external resources  

This firewall is absolute.

---

## 9. Temporal Boundaries

Community interaction must be **time-aware**.

Rules:
- Threads expire naturally
- Events conclude cleanly
- No infinite conversations
- No perpetual private channels

Community is **episodic**, not continuous presence.

---

## 10. Exit & Autonomy Law

Users must be able to:
- leave discussions silently
- disengage without explanation
- participate without visibility
- return without penalty

No social pressure to remain active.

---

## 11. Safety Escalation & Shutdown

In cases of:
• conflict escalation  
• emotional distress  
• ideological rigidity  
• group polarization  

The system must:
- slow interactions
- reduce visibility
- lock threads if needed
- prioritize safety over continuity

Community continuity is never more important than dignity.

---

## 12. Feature Flag & Rollout Control

All community features must be:
• feature-flagged  
• chapter-scoped  
• reversible  
• incrementally released  

Community can be:
- partially active
- fully disabled
- temporarily suspended

No permanent obligation.

---

## 13. Enforcement Mechanisms

VKAD-14 is enforced by:

• structural separation of community routes  
• feature flags  
• moderation tooling  
• language linting (future)  
• human oversight  

If uncertain, **close the interaction**.

---

## 14. Closing Statement

> **Community is not where truth is decided.  
It is where practice is supported.**

When community forgets its limits,  
it harms both individuals and tradition.

Boundaries are not restrictions.  
They are protection.
