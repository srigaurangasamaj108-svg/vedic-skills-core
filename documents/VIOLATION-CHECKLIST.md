# VEDIC SKILLS — VIOLATION CHECKLIST  
*Operational Enforcement of VKAD-01 → VKAD-14*

---

## 0. Purpose

This checklist exists to:
- enforce constitutional doctrine
- prevent silent drift
- guide reviews (content, UI, features)
- protect users, canon, and intent

This checklist must be used during:
• content publishing  
• UI/UX changes  
• new features  
• navigation changes  
• community rollout  
• guidance additions  

If a violation is detected, **the change must not ship**.

---

## 1. Canon & Knowledge Integrity (VKAD-01 → VKAD-06)

### ❓ Canonical Integrity
- ⬜ Does this change preserve canonical sequence?
- ⬜ Is scripture presented without reinterpretation?
- ⬜ Are verses quoted verbatim and unaltered?
- ⬜ Is derived content clearly labeled as non-canonical?

❌ Violation if:

## 2. Reading Experience & UI (VKAD-03, VKAD-10)

---

## 3. Navigation & Cognitive Load (VKAD-11)

### ❓ Navigation Restraint

---

## 4. Progressive Disclosure (VKAD-12)

❌ Violation if:
- complexity is revealed automatically
- system infers readiness
- advanced views are sticky

---

## 5. Search & Discovery (VKAD-08)

### ❓ Discovery Ethics
- ⬜ Does search prioritize canon over commentary?

---

## 6. Guidance & Mentoring Safety (VKAD-13)

---

## 7. Community Interaction (VKAD-14)

### ❓ Boundary Enforcement
- ⬜ Is community structurally separate from library?
- ⬜ Does community avoid interpretation?
- ⬜ Are engagement mechanics absent?

❌ Violation if:
- likes, reactions, or rankings exist
- discussions influence canon visibility
- authority emerges socially

---

### ❓ Moderation & Tone
- ⬜ Is moderation quiet and non-performative?
- ⬜ Are conflicts slowed, not escalated?
- ⬜ Can users disengage silently?

❌ Violation if:
- moderation is public shaming
- debates are incentivized
- users are pressured to participate

---

## 8. Feature Flags & Rollout (VKAD-10, VKAD-14)

### ❓ Control & Reversibility
- ⬜ Is the feature behind a flag?
- ⬜ Can it be disabled instantly?
- ⬜ Is rollout incremental?

❌ Violation if:
- feature is irreversible
- users are forced into changes
- rollback is unclear

---

## 9. Cross-Doctrine Conflict Resolution

If a feature passes some checks but fails others:

Priority order:
1. Canon protection (VKAD-01)
2. Safety (VKAD-13)
3. Disclosure timing (VKAD-12)
4. Navigation restraint (VKAD-11)
5. Community containment (VKAD-14)

When in doubt → **remove or simplify**.

---

## 10. Final Rule

> **If justification requires explanation, the feature is premature.**

Silence, restraint, and clarity are signals of correctness.
