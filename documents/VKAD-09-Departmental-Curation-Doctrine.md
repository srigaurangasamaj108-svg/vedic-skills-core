# VKAD-09: DEPARTMENTAL CURATION, COMMUNITY DOMAINS & INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine defines **how organized human activity (institutions, departments, programs, and communities)** may exist within the Vedic Skills ecosystem.

It exists to ensure that:

• institutions serve śāstra, not replace it  
• departments curate, not dictate  
• community action remains ethical and reversible  
• governance remains humble and bounded  
• no human structure acquires doctrinal authority  

Without this doctrine, platforms drift from *custodianship* into *control*.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Śāstra precedes institution.  
Institution exists to serve understanding,  
not to define truth.**

Departments, programs, and communities are **downstream consequences** of study — never upstream authorities.

---

## 2. WHAT A “DEPARTMENT / VIBHĀGA” IS (CLEAR DEFINITION)

A Department (Vibhāga) is:

• a **curated domain of collective activity**  
• a **lens of application**, not interpretation  
• a **playlist of existing knowledge atoms**  

A department does **not** create new doctrine.

---

### 2.1 What a Department IS

• a structured focus area (e.g. Education, Family Support, Youth)  
• a curator of verses, concepts, guidance, and courses  
• a facilitator of programs  

---

### 2.2 What a Department IS NOT

❌ a source of śāstric authority  
❌ a theological school  
❌ a replacement for sampradāya  
❌ a command structure  

---

## 3. DEPARTMENTAL CONTENT MODEL

Departments are **defined, not populated**, by content.

### 3.1 Storage Location

Department definitions live in:

src/content/community/vibhagas/
Each department file contains:

• scope and purpose  
• ethical boundaries  
• relevant themes  
• links to:
  – verses  
  – concepts  
  – guidance  
  – courses  
  – programs  

---

### 3.2 Department as Playlist (Critical)

A department is effectively a **curated playlist**, not a content silo.

It references:
• verse IDs  
• concept entities  
• guidance modules  
• study tracks  

It never duplicates content.

---

## 4. PROGRAMS & INITIATIVES

Programs are **time-bound expressions** of departments.

Examples:
• reading circles  
• workshops  
• mentoring cohorts  

Programs:

• live in `src/content/community/programs/`  
• declare start/end scope  
• reference departments  
• may be retired without loss  

No program is permanent by default.

---

## 5. COMMUNITY VS DATABASE (STRICT SEPARATION)

### 5.1 What Lives in Content

• department definitions  
• program descriptions  
• ethical guidelines  

---

### 5.2 What Lives in Databases (Never in Content)

❌ attendance  
❌ RSVPs  
❌ user messages  
❌ feedback  
❌ participation logs  

Databases store **activity**, not knowledge.

---

## 6. GOVERNANCE MODEL (HUMILITY-FIRST)

### 6.1 No Centralized Doctrinal Authority

The platform does **not** decide:
• theological correctness  
• interpretive superiority  

It hosts **plural, traceable traditions**.

---

### 6.2 Governance Scope

Governance may decide:

• editorial standards  
• ethical boundaries  
• safety policies  
• feature visibility  

Governance must **never decide meaning**.

---

## 7. DEPARTMENTAL VISIBILITY & UX

Departments:

• are not homepage defaults  
• appear after user intent  
• are framed as “ways to engage,” not “what to believe”  

Departments must never appear as:
❌ belief systems  
❌ ideological banners  
❌ prescriptive life paths  

---

## 8. FEATURE FLAGS & INSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT

All community features must be:

• feature-flagged  
• reversible  
• degradable  

The platform must be able to:
• disable all community features  
• without affecting canon, study, or guidance  

This ensures **institutional humility**.

---

## 9. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• institutional overreach  
• bureaucratization of dharma  
• ideology disguised as seva  
• community replacing study  
• governance becoming authority  

---

## 10. SUCCESS CRITERIA (POSITIVE TEST)

The system is healthy when:

• scripture can exist without community  
• community cannot exist without scripture  
• departments feel optional  
• no user feels coerced  
• meaning remains upstream  

---

## 11. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Institutions are scaffolding.  
Śāstra is the foundation.**

Scaffolding must always be removable  
without damaging the foundation it served.
