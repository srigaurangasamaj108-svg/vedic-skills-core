# VKAD-07: THEME PAGES, VISIBILITY & UX EXPOSURE MODEL  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine defines **how themes, taxonomies, and conceptual lenses are exposed (or hidden) in the user experience**.

It exists to ensure that:

• scripture is always encountered first  
• themes assist discovery, not replace reading  
• beginners are not overwhelmed  
• scholars are not constrained  
• ideology never precedes canon  

This document governs **visibility**, not classification itself.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Themes may guide navigation,  
but they must never become the primary doorway to scripture.**

Canon precedes concept.  
Text precedes theme.  
Reading precedes filtering.

---

## 2. VISIBILITY TIERS (CRITICAL MODEL)

The platform recognizes **three UX visibility tiers**.

Each tier determines:
• what users see  
• when they see it  
• how prominently it appears  

---

### 2.1 Tier A — Canon-First Visibility (Default)

**Applies to**
• first-time users  
• general readers  
• library reading mode  

**Visible**
• text structure (book → chapter → verse)  
• previous / next navigation  
• translation toggle  

**Hidden**
❌ theme pages  
❌ taxonomy browsers  
❌ conceptual dashboards  

Themes may appear only as:
• subtle labels  
• secondary metadata  
• optional filters  

Canon must remain the primary experience.

---

### 2.2 Tier B — Assisted Discovery Visibility

**Applies to**
• registered users  
• study mode  
• guided exploration  

**Visible**
• theme filters (controlled)  
• concept links  
• course pathways  

**Constraints**
• themes appear **after** text selection  
• never before scripture  

Themes assist *after reading begins*.

---

### 2.3 Tier C — Scholarly / Editorial Visibility

**Applies to**
• scholars  
• editors  
• advanced users  

**Visible**
• full taxonomy graphs  
• theme intersections  
• inheritance traces  

This tier exposes **structure**, not interpretation.

---

## 3. THEME PAGES — PERMISSIONED EXISTENCE

Theme pages **are allowed**, but tightly constrained.

---

### 3.1 What a Theme Page IS

A theme page is:
• an **index**  
• a **curated gateway**  
• a **map**, not a destination  

It lists:
• verses related to a theme  
• commentary references  
• courses & guidance links  

---

### 3.2 What a Theme Page IS NOT

❌ An explanation of scripture  
❌ A moral position  
❌ A replacement reading path  
❌ A blog article  

Theme pages never speak *for* scripture.

---

## 4. THEME PAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

A theme page must follow this order:

1. Theme definition (brief, neutral)  
2. Scope disclaimer  
3. Canonical verse index  
4. Commentary & study references  
5. Optional guidance links  

No narrative flow.  
No persuasive language.

---

## 5. ENTRY POINT RESTRICTIONS

### 5.1 Forbidden Entry Paths

Users must NOT land on:
❌ theme pages from homepage by default  
❌ theme pages via search autocomplete  
❌ theme pages before selecting a text  

---

### 5.2 Allowed Entry Paths

Theme pages may be accessed via:
• explicit user intent (“Explore themes”)  
• study dashboards  
• scholarly tools  

---

## 6. SEARCH RESULT PRIORITIZATION

Search results must always rank:

1. Canonical verses  
2. Text locations  
3. Concepts (entities)  
4. Courses / guidance  
5. Theme pages  

Theme pages are **never top results**.

---

## 7. UI PRESENTATION RULES

Themes must be presented as:
• quiet  
• secondary  
• dismissible  

Forbidden:
❌ large theme cards near verses  
❌ bold color emphasis  
❌ theme-first layouts  

Themes may guide, never lead.

---

## 8. LIFE-STAGE & CONTEXTUAL VISIBILITY

Life-stage overlays:
• appear only in guidance & study contexts  
• are hidden during canonical reading  

This prevents:
• misapplication  
• over-personalization  
• projection onto canon  

---

## 9. FEATURE FLAGS & PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE

Advanced theme views must be:
• feature-flagged  
• opt-in  
• reversible  

No irreversible exposure.

---

## 10. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• ideology-first browsing  
• theme-driven scripture reading  
• reduction of śāstra to “topics”  
• beginner confusion  
• scholarly oversimplification  

---

## 11. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Themes are maps.  
Scripture is the land.**

No map is ever allowed to replace the land it describes.
