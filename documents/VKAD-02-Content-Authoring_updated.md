# VKAD-02 — Content Authoring Doctrine
*(Revised · Constitution-Locked)*

This doctrine defines **who may author what**, **where it may live**,  
and **how authority boundaries are preserved** during content creation.

No contributor, editor, or automation
may violate this doctrine.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Doctrine

This doctrine exists to ensure that:

• Canon is **never authored**
• Meaning is **never smuggled upward**
• Interpretation is **never confused with source**
• Guidance never becomes prescription
• Automation never becomes authority

Authoring is **layered**, not flat.

---

## 2. Authority Stack (Authoring Perspective)

All authoring operates within this locked stack:

LEVEL 0 — Canon (CKA) ❌ Not authoredLEVEL 1 — Gloss / Concept ✅ Lexical & semanticLEVEL 2 — Entity / Circumstance ✅ ContextualLEVEL 3A — Synonym (Padārtha) ✅ Verse-level lexicalLEVEL 3B — Translation ✅ Linguistic renderingLEVEL 3C — Commentary ✅ Interpretive expositionLEVEL 4 — Principle ✅ Abstracted truthLEVEL 5 — Skill ✅ Cultivable capacityLEVEL 6 — Guidance ✅ Contextual application
Each level:

• may depend only on lower levels  
• may not overwrite lower levels  
• may be removed without collapsing Canon  

---

## 3. Canon Is Not Authored (LEVEL 0)

Canonical content:

• is received, not written  
• is preserved verbatim  
• is immutable by doctrine  

### Authoring Rules

❌ No one may “write” canon  
❌ No one may paraphrase canon  
❌ No one may embed meaning in canon  

Canon ingestion is **mechanical**, not creative.

---

## 4. Lexical Authoring (LEVELS 1 & 3A)

### 4.1 Gloss Atoms (LEVEL 1)

Gloss Atoms define:

• word meaning across **multiple usages**
• semantic range, not verse-specific meaning

Gloss Atoms:

• may reference multiple CKAs  
• may evolve by **adding references**, not redefining meaning  

They answer:

> “How is this word used in śāstra?”

---

### 4.2 Synonym Atoms (LEVEL 3A)

**Synonyms are NOT canon.**

Synonym Atoms represent:

• verse-specific padārtha / anvaya  
• traditional word-by-word mappings  

They answer:

> “How do the words of *this verse* map to meaning?”

### Critical Rules

• One Synonym Atom per verse  
• Must reference exactly one CKA  
• Must not generalize beyond that verse  
• Must not explain philosophy  

Synonym Atoms are **lexical aids**, not interpretation.

---

## 5. Contextual Authoring (LEVEL 2)

Entity & Circumstance Atoms describe:

• who
• where
• when
• under what human condition

They are:

• descriptive only  
• non-interpretive  
• non-psychological  

They answer:

> “What is the context of this śāstric moment?”

They **must not** answer why or how to act.

---

## 6. Interpretive Authoring (LEVEL 3B & 3C)

### 6.1 Translation (LEVEL 3B)

Translations are:

• linguistic renderings  
• not explanations  
• not commentary  

Rules:

• One verse per file  
• One translator per file  
• No Sanskrit in body  
• No explanatory tone  

They answer:

> “How is this verse rendered in another language?”

---

### 6.2 Commentary (LEVEL 3C)

Commentary Atoms contain:

• traditional bhāṣya / ṭīkā / purport  
• attributed to an ācārya or author  

Rules:

• Must reference CKAs  
• Must not reproduce Canon verbatim  
• May exist in Sanskrit or translation (separately)  

Commentary answers:

> “How has this verse been explained within a lineage?”

---

## 7. Abstraction Authoring (LEVEL 4)

### Principle Atoms

Principles:

• abstract truth statements  
• grounded explicitly in CKAs  
• non-procedural  

They answer:

> “What truth is established?”

They **must not** answer what to do.

---

## 8. Capacity Authoring (LEVEL 5)

### Skill Atoms

Skills describe:

• cultivated abilities  
• internal capacities  
• ethical or cognitive readiness  

Rules:

• Must reference Principles  
• Must reference CKAs  
• Must not contain instructions  

They answer:

> “What capacity can be developed from this understanding?”

---

## 9. Application Authoring (LEVEL 6)

### Guidance Atoms

Guidance is:

• contextual  
• time-bound  
• non-prescriptive  

Rules:

• Must declare scope & risk  
• Must include guardrails  
• Must stop before advice  

They answer:

> “How might this be reflected upon in this situation?”

Guidance must **never** replace:

• teachers  
• counselors  
• professionals  

---

## 10. Automation as Authoring Assistant

Automation may:

• scaffold files  
• enforce schemas  
• validate dependencies  

Automation may **not**:

❌ generate doctrine  
❌ invent principles  
❌ escalate authority  
❌ personalize guidance  

Automation is a **scribe**, not a teacher.

---

## 11. Editorial Governance

All authored content must declare:

• draft / reviewed / published  
• attribution where applicable  

Canon is exempt — it is never “published,” only preserved.

---

## 12. Constitutional Priority

If any authoring practice conflicts with this doctrine:

👉 **This doctrine prevails.**
