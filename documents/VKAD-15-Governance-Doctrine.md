# VKAD-15 — Governance Doctrine

---

## 0. Status & Scope

**Doctrine Level:** Constitutional (Phase II)  
**Applies To:** Decision-making, policy changes, doctrine updates, disputes  

VKAD-15 governs **who may decide what**, and **how decisions are made**.

It exists to prevent:
• silent authority drift  
• charismatic control  
• founder absolutism  
• factional governance  

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **No authority is implied.  
All authority is declared.**

If authority is not named, it does not exist.

---

## 2. Governance Layers (Mandatory Separation)

The platform recognizes **four governance layers**:

### 2.1 Canon Guardians
- Protect VKAD-01 → VKAD-09
- May veto changes that dilute canon
- Cannot modify UI, community, or guidance

### 2.2 System Stewards
- Maintain architecture, UI, performance
- May not alter doctrine or canon
- Operate under violation checklist

### 2.3 Guidance Council
- Oversees VKAD-13
- Approves guidance patterns
- May suspend guidance features for safety

### 2.4 Community Moderators
- Enforce VKAD-14
- Moderate tone and boundaries
- Cannot interpret scripture or doctrine

No individual may hold more than **one role simultaneously**.

## 3. Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Authority |
|---|---|
| Canon definition | Canon Guardians |
| UI behavior | System Stewards |
| Guidance content | Guidance Council |
| Community norms | Moderators |
| Doctrine amendment | Supermajority (see §5) |

---

## 4. Transparency Rule

All governance decisions must be:
- documented
- timestamped
- attributable to a role (not a person)

No anonymous authority.

---

## 5. Doctrine Amendment Protocol

VKAD doctrines may only be amended if:
1. A written proposal exists
2. Impact analysis is provided
3. A supermajority of relevant guardians approves
4. A cooling-off period passes

Doctrine changes are **rare by design**.

---

## 6. Conflict Resolution

If governance bodies disagree:
1. Pause implementation
2. Revert to last stable state
3. Apply higher-layer doctrine
4. Choose restraint over expansion

---

## 7. Closing Statement

> **Governance exists to limit power, not to wield it.**
