# VKAD-17 — Succession & Continuity Doctrine

---

## 0. Status & Scope

**Doctrine Level:** Constitutional (Phase II)  
**Applies To:** Leadership transition, long-term continuity  

VKAD-17 ensures the platform:
• does not collapse with individuals  
• does not freeze around founders  
• does not drift after departure  

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **Continuity is designed, not hoped for.**

---

## 2. Anti-Founder Lock Doctrine

Founders:
- hold no permanent authority
- may not override doctrine
- must define succession early

Founders are **initial stewards**, not perpetual leaders.

---

## 3. Knowledge Preservation

All critical knowledge must be:
- written
- versioned
- accessible
- non-personal

No operational dependency on memory or charisma.

---

## 4. Succession Triggers

Succession planning activates when:
- a steward steps down
- inactivity exceeds limits
- conflict of interest arises
- health or safety concerns exist

Succession is **procedural, not political**.

---

## 5. Institutional Memory

The system preserves:
- doctrine history
- rationale for decisions
- deprecated paths

Forgetting is treated as risk.

---

## 6. Dissolution Safeguard

If the platform must ever end:
- canon remains accessible
- data is not held hostage
- community is informed calmly

No abrupt disappearance.

---

## 7. Closing Statement

> **A tradition survives by design, not by devotion alone.**

---

*End of VKAD-17*
