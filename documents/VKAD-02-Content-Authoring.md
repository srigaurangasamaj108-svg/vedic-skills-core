# VKAD-02: CONTENT AUTHORING, COMMENTARY SEPARATION & EDITORIAL ETHICS  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine governs **how humans write, edit, translate, and curate content** within the Vedic Skills ecosystem.

It exists to ensure that:

• Canon is never distorted by opinion  
• Commentary never masquerades as scripture  
• Guidance never becomes prescription  
• Automation never invents meaning  
• Scale never erodes integrity  

If **any authoring practice** conflicts with this document, the practice must be stopped — regardless of convenience or speed.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Scripture preserves meaning as received.  
Purport explains meaning as taught.  
Guidance reflects meaning as lived.**

These three **must never collapse into one another**.

---

## 2. CONTENT LAYER CLASSIFICATION (MANDATORY)

All authored content belongs to **exactly one layer**.

No file may belong to multiple layers.

### 2.1 Canonical Layer (Verse Atoms)

• Sanskrit verses  
• Mantras  
• Sūtras  

Governed entirely by **VKAD-01**.

❌ No commentary  
❌ No explanation  
❌ No application  

---

### 2.2 Commentary Layer (Traditional Interpretation)

**Commentary** is defined as:

> A traditional scholastic explanation authored by a recognized ācārya or lineage.

Examples:
• Śrīdhara Svāmī  
• Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura  
• Rāmānuja  
• Madhusūdana Sarasvatī  

Commentary **belongs to the tradition**, not the editor.

---

### 2.3 Purport Layer (Pedagogical Explanation)

**Purport** is defined as:

> An explanatory teaching intended to make scripture accessible to a specific audience or era.

Examples:
• Śrīla Prabhupāda’s purports  
• Institutional explanations  
• Introductory teaching notes  

Purports are:
• pedagogical  
• audience-aware  
• time-bound  

They are **never canonical**.

---

### 2.4 Guidance Layer (Contextual Reflection)

Guidance is defined as:

> Contextual reflection on śāstra for specific life situations.

Guidance:
• is situational  
• is non-prescriptive  
• includes ethical disclaimers  

Guidance **must never claim universality**.

---

### 2.5 Study Layer (Pedagogical Structure)

Courses, modules, and tracks are **learning structures**, not content authority.

They:
• reference scripture  
• sequence material  
• recommend pathways  

They never reinterpret canon.

---

### 2.6 Community Layer (Institutional Definition)

Community content defines:
• seva domains  
• programs  
• ethical frameworks  

Community content **never stores user activity**.

---

## 3. COMMENTARY AUTHORING DOCTRINE (CRITICAL)

### 3.1 One Commentary = One Author = One File

Each commentary file:

• represents **one ācārya**  
• addresses **one verse or verse range**  
• is stored independently  

Example:

commentaries/bhagavad-gita/02/47-vct.mdxcommentaries/bhagavad-gita/02/47-srs.mdx
This allows:
• dynamic switching of ācāryas  
• parallel traditions  
• independent evolution  

---

### 3.2 Commentary Must Anchor to Canon

Every commentary file **must reference**:

• verse ID(s)  
• text identity  
• author entity  

It must **never duplicate the verse text**.

The verse is always rendered from the canonical atom.

---

### 3.3 Translation of Commentaries

Translations of commentaries:

• are allowed  
• are editorial  
• must be explicitly attributed  

They may be:
• inline  
• or separate MDX atoms  

But they **must never replace the original commentary language**.

---

## 4. PURPORT AUTHORING RULES

### 4.1 Purports Are Explicitly Non-Canonical

Every purport must clearly indicate:

• author  
• audience  
• historical context  

Purports **may evolve** over time.

They are allowed to:
• simplify  
• contextualize  
• paraphrase  

They are **never allowed to override verse meaning**.

---

### 4.2 Purports Are Separate Atoms

Purports must live in:

src/content/purports/
They must:
• reference verse IDs  
• reference concepts  
• never embed canonical text  

---

## 5. GUIDANCE AUTHORING ETHICS (SAFETY LAYER)

### 5.1 Non-Prescriptive Language (Mandatory)

Guidance must use:
• reflective language  
• invitational tone  

Forbidden:
❌ “You must”  
❌ “This guarantees”  
❌ “This will cure”  
❌ Psychological diagnosis  

---

### 5.2 Life-Stage Scoping

Every guidance file must declare:
• intended life stage(s)  
• scope of applicability  

This prevents “one-size-fits-all” harm.

---

### 5.3 Mandatory Disclaimers

Guidance layouts automatically inject:

• non-medical disclaimer  
• non-legal disclaimer  
• humility notice  

Authors must **not remove or weaken** these.

---

## 6. STUDY & COURSE AUTHORING RULES

Courses are **paths through knowledge**, not authorities.

### Courses may:
• recommend verses  
• group concepts  
• suggest order  

Courses may NOT:
❌ redefine scripture  
❌ override commentary  
❌ issue moral judgments  

---

## 7. COMMUNITY CONTENT RULES

Community content defines **structure**, not activity.

Allowed:
• program definitions  
• ethical rules  
• facilitator roles  

Forbidden:
❌ advice to individuals  
❌ counseling  
❌ personal data  

---

## 8. AUTOMATION & SCALE SAFEGUARDS

Automation tools may:
• split files  
• generate templates  
• validate schemas  

Automation must NEVER:
❌ invent interpretation  
❌ summarize scripture  
❌ infer moral conclusions  

All meaning remains human-curated.

---

## 9. EDITORIAL ACCOUNTABILITY

Every non-canonical file must declare:

• author / curator  
• date  
• revision notes  

Anonymous authority is forbidden.

---

## 10. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• commentary leaking into canon  
• modern opinion disguised as śāstra  
• therapeutic misuse of scripture  
• institutional overreach  
• algorithmic meaning creation  

---

## 11. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Canon is received.  
Commentary is inherited.  
Purport is taught.  
Guidance is offered.  
Community is lived.**

Confuse these layers — and the system fails.

Honor them — and the system scales safely to millions of files.
