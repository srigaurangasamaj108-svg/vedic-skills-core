# VKAD-03: READING EXPERIENCE, UI DOCTRINE & VISUAL SILENCE  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine defines **how sacred knowledge may be presented to human attention**.

It governs:
• layout  
• typography  
• interaction  
• navigation  
• motion  
• emphasis  

This is not a design guideline.
This is an **ethical constraint system**.

If any UI decision:
• distracts from meaning  
• competes with scripture  
• manipulates emotion  
• gamifies attention  

— it violates this doctrine and must be removed.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE — VISUAL SILENCE

> **The interface must be quieter than the content.**

Sacred reading requires:
• stillness  
• continuity  
• non-urgency  

The UI exists only to **get out of the way**.

---

## 2. MODES OF ATTENTION (CRITICAL)

The platform explicitly recognizes **three attention modes**.

Each mode has different UI permissions.

---

### 2.1 Reading Mode (Primary Mode)

**Purpose**  
Deep, uninterrupted engagement with scripture.

**Applies to**
• Library verse pages  
• Commentary reading  
• Canonical PDFs  

**UI Rules**
• No sidebars  
• No pop-ups  
• No notifications  
• No infinite scroll  
• No “related content” injections  

Allowed:
• verse text  
• translation toggle  
• commentary accordion  
• minimal navigation (Previous / Next)

This mode must feel:
• slow  
• spacious  
• timeless  

---

### 2.2 Study Mode (Structured Attention)

**Purpose**  
Guided learning and conceptual sequencing.

**Applies to**
• Courses  
• Modules  
• Playlists  

**UI Rules**
• Clear progression indicators  
• Visible structure  
• Controlled cross-links  

Forbidden:
❌ autoplay  
❌ recommendation engines  
❌ urgency cues (“Complete now”)  

Study is **intentional**, not addictive.

---

### 2.3 Guidance Mode (Sensitive Context)

**Purpose**  
Reflection during vulnerability or uncertainty.

**Applies to**
• Life-stage guidance  
• Crisis reflection  

**UI Rules**
• Mandatory disclaimers  
• Gentle typography  
• No bold claims  
• No “solutions” framing  

Guidance layouts must **slow the reader**, not push action.

---

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY DOCTRINE

### 3.1 Hierarchy of Fonts

Typography encodes **epistemic hierarchy**.

1. **Sanskrit (Primary Canon)**  
   • Serif  
   • Traditional  
   • High legibility  

2. **Translation**  
   • Subordinate size  
   • Neutral tone  

3. **Commentary / Purport**  
   • Clearly differentiated  
   • Never larger than canon  

4. **UI Text**  
   • Quiet  
   • Functional  
   • Never expressive  

No font choice may compete with Sanskrit.

---

### 3.2 Forbidden Typography Practices

❌ Decorative fonts  
❌ Handwritten styles  
❌ Dramatic italics for emphasis  
❌ Emoji or icons near scripture  

---

## 4. COLOR & VISUAL ENERGY

### 4.1 Color Philosophy

Color exists only to:
• separate layers  
• aid legibility  
• indicate structure  

Color must **never express emotion**.

---

### 4.2 Forbidden Visual Techniques

❌ Bright call-to-action buttons near scripture  
❌ Red / green emotional signaling  
❌ Gradients behind verses  
❌ Animations that attract attention  

---

## 5. INTERACTION DOCTRINE

### 5.1 No Gamification (Absolute Rule)

The platform must never include:
❌ streaks  
❌ points  
❌ badges  
❌ leaderboards  
❌ “You are ahead of others”  

Spiritual study is not a competition.

---

### 5.2 No Algorithmic Manipulation

Forbidden:
❌ “Recommended for you”  
❌ Popular verses  
❌ Trending topics  

Canon order is **traditional**, not statistical.

---

## 6. NAVIGATION DOCTRINE

### 6.1 Canonical Navigation

Primary navigation follows **text structure**, not themes.

Examples:
• Chapter → Verse  
• Canto → Chapter → Verse  
• Kāṇḍa → Sarga → Verse  

Themes, life-stages, and courses are **secondary overlays**.

---

### 6.2 Minimalism Rule

Navigation must:
• be predictable  
• be reversible  
• never surprise  

Users should never feel “pulled”.

---

## 7. ASTRO ISLANDS & HYBRID RENDERING

### 7.1 Static by Default

All scripture and commentary:
• pre-rendered  
• static HTML  
• zero JavaScript required  

This ensures:
• speed  
• longevity  
• offline compatibility  

---

### 7.2 Islands Only Where Necessary

Interactive islands are permitted only for:
• search  
• toggles  
• commentary switching  
• language selection  

Islands must:
• load lazily  
• be visually quiet  
• never interrupt reading  

---

## 8. FEATURE FLAG VISIBILITY

All major UI features must be:
• coded early  
• hidden by default  

Examples:
• community panels  
• advanced search  
• overlays  

No feature may appear without explicit activation.

---

## 9. ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSIVITY

### 9.1 Cognitive Accessibility

The UI must support:
• long attention spans  
• low stimulation  
• slow reading  

Avoid:
❌ dense UI  
❌ constant choices  
❌ aggressive prompts  

---

### 9.2 Language Sensitivity

Language switching:
• must be explicit  
• never automatic  
• never forced  

---

## 10. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• Instagram-style scripture  
• TikTok-style consumption  
• motivational poster spirituality  
• UI replacing meaning  
• attention addiction  

---

## 11. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **The interface must disappear before the verse does.**

If a user remembers the UI more than the śloka,
the design has failed.

Silence is the highest form of respect.
