# VEDIC SKILLS — CONSTITUTION INDEX  
*A Structural Map of VKAD-01 → VKAD-14*

---

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document is **not doctrine**.

It exists to:
- map the VKAD constitution
- show relationships between doctrines
- define scope boundaries
- prevent overlap and contradiction
- guide enforcement and review

All VKAD documents derive authority **individually**;  
this index provides **orientation**, not interpretation.

---

## 1. Constitutional Layers Overview

The VKAD constitution is organized into **five layers**, each governing a distinct dimension of the system.

LAYER I — Knowledge & CanonLAYER II — Access, Discovery & TaxonomyLAYER III — Interface & CognitionLAYER IV — Guidance & Human SafetyLAYER V — Community & Social Boundaries
Each doctrine belongs to **exactly one primary layer**, though it may influence others.

---

## 2. Layer I — Knowledge & Canon (Truth Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Protect the integrity, hierarchy, and meaning of śāstra and derived knowledge.

| VKAD | Title | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| VKAD-01 | Canon Doctrine | What qualifies as canonical knowledge |
| VKAD-02 | Content Authoring Doctrine | How content is written and structured |
| VKAD-03 | Reading Experience UI Doctrine | How scripture is encountered |
| VKAD-04 | PDF & Reference Doctrine | External material classification |
| VKAD-05 | Theme & Taxonomy Doctrine | Conceptual classification |
| VKAD-06 | Theme Assignment Playbook | How themes are applied |
| VKAD-07 | Theme Pages & Visibility | How themes are surfaced |
| VKAD-08 | Search & Discovery Doctrine | How content is found |
| VKAD-09 | Departmental Curation Doctrine | Vibhāga / Seva organization |

**Primary Protection:**  
Canon must never be diluted, reordered, or reinterpreted implicitly.

---

## 3. Layer II — Access & Discovery (Orientation Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Ensure users can *find* without being *overwhelmed*.

This layer is **shared authority** between:

- VKAD-07 (Theme Visibility)
- VKAD-08 (Search)
- VKAD-11 (Navigation)

**Key Rule:**  
Discovery must never precede understanding.

---

## 4. Layer III — Interface & Cognition (UX Law Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Govern how the human mind encounters complexity.

| VKAD | Title | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| VKAD-10 | UI Interaction Doctrine | What interactions are allowed |
| VKAD-11 | Navigation & Cognitive Load | Movement and choice limits |
| VKAD-12 | Progressive Disclosure Doctrine | When complexity is revealed |

**Hierarchy within Layer III:**
VKAD-12 (Disclosure timing)↑VKAD-11 (Navigation structure)↑VKAD-10 (Interaction mechanics)
**Interpretation Rule:**  
If doctrines conflict, **earlier disclosure beats later interaction**.

---

## 5. Layer IV — Guidance & Human Safety (Ethical Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Protect users from harm, misuse, and authority confusion.

| VKAD | Title | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| VKAD-13 | Mentoring, Guidance & Safety UX | All guidance interactions |

**Override Authority:**  
VKAD-13 overrides **all other VKADs** in crisis or vulnerability contexts.

If safety conflicts with:
- navigation → slow navigation
- interaction → reduce interaction
- disclosure → restrict disclosure

Safety wins.

---

## 6. Layer V — Community & Social Boundaries (Containment Layer)

**Purpose:**  
Prevent social dynamics from corrupting truth or guidance.

| VKAD | Title | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| VKAD-14 | Community Interaction & Boundary Doctrine | All human-to-human interaction |

**Absolute Rule:**  
Community must never reinterpret canon or replace guidance.

VKAD-14 has **hard containment authority**.

---

## 7. Doctrine Dependency Graph (Simplified)

VKAD-01 (Canon)↓VKAD-02 → VKAD-05 → VKAD-06 → VKAD-07↓ ↓VKAD-08 (Search) VKAD-09 (Departments)↓VKAD-10 → VKAD-11 → VKAD-12↓VKAD-13↓VKAD-14
This graph expresses **conceptual dependency**, not implementation order.

---

## 8. Conflict Resolution Rules

When two doctrines appear to conflict:

1. Canon protection (VKAD-01) overrides all
2. Safety (VKAD-13) overrides UI and discovery
3. Disclosure timing (VKAD-12) overrides interaction
4. Navigation (VKAD-11) overrides convenience
5. Community (VKAD-14) overrides engagement

If still ambiguous → **reduce functionality**.

---

## 9. How to Use This Index

This index is used to:
- onboard contributors
- justify architectural decisions
- review pull requests
- prevent scope creep
- guide future Phase II doctrines

It must be read **before**:
- architecture.md
- UI blueprint documents
- governance expansions

---

## 10. Closing Note

> **Doctrine gives the system a spine.  
The index lets it stand upright.**

Without this map, even correct doctrines drift.
