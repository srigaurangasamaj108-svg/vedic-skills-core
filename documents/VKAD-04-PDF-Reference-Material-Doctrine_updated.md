# VKAD-04 — PDF & Reference Material Doctrine
*(Revised · Constitution-Locked)*

This doctrine governs the creation, scope, and usage of **PDFs and static reference materials**.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
• PDFs support śāstra study without replacing live reading
• Canon is never duplicated as a competing authority
• Reference materials remain derivative, bounded, and honest
• Print-friendly artifacts do not collapse doctrinal layers

PDFs are **containers**, not sources of truth.

---

## 1. Foundational Rule

> **No PDF may introduce, redefine, or replace Canon.**

All PDFs are **derived artifacts** and must remain visibly subordinate to the live canonical system.

---

## 2. What PDFs Are (and Are Not)

### 2.1 PDFs ARE

• offline reference artifacts  
• print-friendly study aids  
• curated snapshots of existing atoms  
• pedagogical or archival views  

### 2.2 PDFs ARE NOT

❌ canonical sources  
❌ interpretive authorities  
❌ standalone libraries  
❌ substitutes for the live reader  

A PDF may summarize or assemble — it may never *become* śāstra.

---

## 3. Authority Mapping for PDFs

Every PDF must declare **exactly which authority layers it includes**.

Allowed layers:

LEVEL 0 — Canon (verbatim, unaltered)LEVEL 1 — Gloss / ConceptLEVEL 2 — Entity / CircumstanceLEVEL 3A — Synonym (Padārtha)LEVEL 3B — TranslationLEVEL 3C — CommentaryLEVEL 4 — PrincipleLEVEL 5 — SkillLEVEL 6 — Guidance
### Mandatory Rule

• Layers must appear **in order**
• Higher layers must never appear **without** lower layers
• Canon must always appear **first**

---

## 4. Canon Handling in PDFs (LEVEL 0)

### 4.1 Canon Is Verbatim Only

When Canon is included:

• Sanskrit text only  
• No inline commentary  
• No annotations inside verse text  
• No reflowing that alters meaning  

### 4.2 Canon Must Be Marked

Every page containing Canon must visibly state:

> “Canonical Text (Verbatim) — For reference only”

This prevents PDF drift into authority.

---

## 5. Lexical & Semantic Layers in PDFs

### 5.1 Gloss (LEVEL 1)

Gloss may be included as:

• appendices  
• side sections  
• footnote blocks  

Gloss must remain:

• general  
• cross-verse  
• non-interpretive  

---

### 5.2 Synonyms / Padārtha (LEVEL 3A)

Synonyms are **verse-specific** and may be included directly after the verse.

### Required Label

> “Word-by-Word (Padārtha) — Lexical Mapping”

### Prohibitions

❌ No philosophical explanation  
❌ No extrapolation  
❌ No merging with translation  

---

## 6. Interpretation in PDFs (LEVEL 3B & 3C)

### 6.1 Translation (LEVEL 3B)

Translation inclusion rules:

• One translator per section  
• Translator identity mandatory  
• No blended translations  

Translation must always be labeled:

> “Translation — [Translator Name]”

---

### 6.2 Commentary (LEVEL 3C)

Commentary must obey **strict separation**:

If commentary exists in:
• Sanskrit source text
• Translation of that commentary

They must appear as **distinct subsections**.

Example:

Commentary (Sanskrit) — ŚaṅkaraCommentary (Translation) — [Translator]
No PDF may merge these silently.

---

## 7. Abstraction & Application in PDFs (LEVELS 4–6)

### 7.1 Principles (LEVEL 4)

Allowed only if:

• explicitly derived from cited CKAs  
• presented as declarative statements  
• clearly labeled “Principle (Abstracted)”

---

### 7.2 Skills (LEVEL 5)

Skills may be included only as:

• descriptive capacities  
• never as instructions  

Label required:

> “Skill (Descriptive Capacity)”

---

### 7.3 Guidance (LEVEL 6)

Guidance is **optional and restricted** in PDFs.

If included, it must:

• appear at the end  
• include full guardrails  
• include non-prescriptive disclaimer  

Required label:

> “Contextual Guidance — Reflective Only”

---

## 8. Compilation vs PDF (Critical Distinction)

### Compilation (Content-Level)

• lives in the content system  
• structured, referenceable  
• governed by Compilation Doctrine  

### PDF (Artifact-Level)

• generated output  
• frozen snapshot  
• not referenceable as authority  

PDFs may be generated *from* compilations.
Compilations may **never** be inferred *from* PDFs.

---

## 9. Metadata & Provenance (Mandatory)

Every PDF must declare:

• source verses  
• included layers  
• translators / commentators  
• generation date  
• version hash (if applicable)

This ensures traceability and non-authority.

---

## 10. UI Doctrine Alignment

The UI must:

• treat PDFs as secondary  
• never default to PDFs  
• never privilege PDFs over live reading  

PDF access must be framed as:

> “Downloadable Reference”

Not as “Primary Study Mode”.

---

## 11. Constitutional Priority

If any PDF design or publishing decision conflicts with this doctrine:

👉 **This doctrine overrides convenience, aesthetics, and distribution goals.**
