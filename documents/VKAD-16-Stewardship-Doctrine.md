# VKAD-16 — Stewardship Doctrine

---

## 0. Status & Scope

**Doctrine Level:** Constitutional (Phase II)  
**Applies To:** Content, code, community, data, brand, name  

VKAD-16 governs **care, maintenance, and responsibility over time**.

---

## 1. Core Principle

> **Stewards serve the system.  
The system does not serve stewards.**

No contribution grants ownership.

---

## 2. Stewardship Domains

Stewardship is divided into **domains**, not hierarchy.

| Domain | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Canon | Accuracy, preservation |
| Content | Quality, tone, alignment |
| Code | Stability, security |
| UI | Restraint, clarity |
| Community | Safety, dignity |

Each domain has **named stewards** with limited scope.

---

## 3. Stewardship Obligations

All stewards must:
- preserve reversibility
- avoid personal imprint
- document changes
- prioritize long-term clarity

Stewards may not:
❌ introduce personal ideology  
❌ override doctrine  
❌ accelerate change for convenience  

---

## 4. Stewardship Succession

No stewardship role is permanent.

Each role must have:
- a documented handover process
- shared access (never single point)
- clear exit conditions

---

## 5. Failure & Removal

A steward may be removed if:
- doctrine is violated repeatedly
- authority is implied
- safety is compromised

Removal is quiet, procedural, and documented.

---

## 6. Closing Statement

> **Stewardship is invisible when done correctly.**
