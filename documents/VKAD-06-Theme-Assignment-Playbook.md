# VKAD-06: THEME ASSIGNMENT, INHERITANCE & EDITORIAL PLAYBOOK  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine defines **how classification is applied, inherited, reviewed, and governed** across all content layers.

It exists to ensure that:

• themes remain disciplined  
• meaning is not over-asserted  
• inheritance does not become distortion  
• automation assists but never decides  
• editors act with humility, not authority  

Without this doctrine, even a perfect taxonomy collapses under scale.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Themes are applied by humans,  
inherited by rules,  
and reviewed by conscience.**

No theme is:
• automatic by default  
• permanent by decree  
• invisible in origin  

---

## 2. WHO MAY ASSIGN THEMES (AUTHORITY MODEL)

Theme assignment authority is **layer-specific**.

---

### 2.1 Canonical Layer (Verses)

Rules:
• themes may be assigned **sparingly**  
• at most **two primary lenses**  
• never inferred automatically  

Authority:
• senior editors only  
• scholarly justification required  

If uncertain: **leave unassigned**.

---

### 2.2 Commentary Layer

Rules:
• commentary may inherit verse themes  
• commentary may add **one additional lens** reflecting the ācārya’s emphasis  

Authority:
• trained editors familiar with the tradition  

A commentary never contradicts verse identity.

---

### 2.3 Purport Layer

Rules:
• purports may expand contextual lenses  
• purports may introduce pedagogical framing  

Authority:
• institutional educators  
• explicitly attributed  

Purports must **declare their audience**.

---

### 2.4 Guidance Layer

Rules:
• guidance may apply life-stage overlays  
• guidance must **never re-tag canon**  

Authority:
• guidance council  
• ethical review required  

Guidance themes are **non-transferable upward**.

---

### 2.5 Study & Community Layers

Rules:
• free use of themes  
• may create composite pathways  
• must reference upstream atoms  

Authority:
• program designers  

Study & community themes never flow upward.

---

## 3. THE INHERITANCE MODEL (CRITICAL)

Theme inheritance follows **directional rules**.

---

### 3.1 Allowed Inheritance Paths

Verse → Commentary → Purport → Guidance → Study → Community
Meaning may flow **downward only**.

---

### 3.2 Forbidden Inheritance Paths

❌ Guidance → Verse  
❌ Study → Canon  
❌ Community → Commentary  

Once violated, classification corruption begins.

---

### 3.3 Inheritance Is Optional, Not Mandatory

A child node may:
• inherit all themes  
• inherit some themes  
• inherit none  

Inheritance must be **explicit**, never assumed.

---

## 4. AUTOMATION ASSISTANCE (STRICTLY LIMITED)

Automation may assist in:

• suggesting possible themes  
• flagging inconsistencies  
• detecting missing metadata  

Automation must NEVER:

❌ assign themes silently  
❌ override human judgment  
❌ infer meaning  

All automated suggestions must be **visible and rejectable**.

---

## 5. CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES

When theme conflicts arise:

1. Canonical structure wins  
2. Verse identity wins  
3. Tradition-specific reading wins  
4. Guidance defers  

No conflict is resolved by:
• popularity  
• engagement metrics  
• search demand  

Silence is preferable to false certainty.

---

## 6. REVIEW & REVISION CYCLE

Themes are **living annotations**, not static truth.

Rules:
• all theme assignments are revisable  
• revision history must be preserved  
• reversions must be explainable  

No silent edits.

---

## 7. DOCUMENTATION & TRACEABILITY

Every theme assignment must record:

• who assigned it  
• when  
• why  

Anonymous classification is forbidden.

---

## 8. EDITORIAL RESTRAINT DOCTRINE

Editors must practice:

• under-classification  
• humility  
• reversibility  

The goal is **clarity**, not completeness.

---

## 9. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• theme inflation  
• ideological tagging  
• automation-driven distortion  
• editorial ego  
• silent drift over years  

---

## 10. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Inheritance must preserve meaning,  
not amplify interpretation.**

If themes grow faster than canon,
classification has replaced understanding.
