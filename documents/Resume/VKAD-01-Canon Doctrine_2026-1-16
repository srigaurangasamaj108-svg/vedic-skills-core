VKAD-01 — Canon Doctrine
(Final · Constitution-Locked · Implementation-Aligned)
This doctrine defines what Canon is, where it lives, what it may contain,and what it must never contain in the Vedic Skills system.
No schema, script, UI, automation, AI behavior, or governance decisionmay violate this doctrine.
If a conflict arises:
👉 Canon prevails.👉 Automation must fail.👉 UI must change.

1. Definition of Canon
Canon refers exclusively to Canonical Knowledge Atoms (CKA).
A CKA is:
• the smallest indivisible unit of śāstra• preserved verbatim in the original language• immutable• sequential• context-descriptive only• authority-complete in itself
Canon is received, never authored.

2. Canonical Knowledge Atom (CKA)
Each CKA represents:
• one verse (śloka / mantra / sūtra), or• the smallest authoritative textual unit where verses do not apply
Each CKA:
• exists in exactly one file• has one canonical location• may be referenced but never duplicated
There is:
• no theme without CKAs• no principle without CKAs• no guidance without CKAs

3. Canonical Authority Stack (LOCKED)
The canonical corpus is structured as a non-linear authority graph, not a ladder.
The recognized LEVEL-0 Canon corpora are:
	1	Śruti — apauruṣeya revelation
	2	Smṛti — remembered application of Śruti
	3	Itihāsa — narrative Smṛti
	4	Purāṇa — theological Smṛti
	5	Āgama / Tantra — ritual systems aligned with Śruti
	6	Vedāṅga — auxiliary limbs preserving Śruti
	7	Upaveda — applied śāstra derived from Veda
	8	Darśana — philosophical interpretation via sūtra
Authority Rules
• This stack applies only to Canon (LEVEL-0)• Authority is declared, never inferred• Derived layers may read this authority• Derived layers may never override it

4. Sampradāya Is NOT Canon (CRITICAL)
Sampradāya (e.g. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism) is:
• a living interpretive tradition• grounded in Canon• historically situated• devotional and hermeneutical
Therefore:
❌ Sampradāya is not Canon❌ Sampradāya does not add authority❌ Sampradāya does not override hierarchy
Sampradāya lives in:
src/content/sampradaya/
and carries its own declared:
authority_scope: "sampradaya"

5. Canon Folder Law (ABSOLUTE)
All Canon must live only under:
src/content/scripture/
The folder path encodes corpus membership, not interpretation.
Valid example:
src/content/scripture/
└── itihasa/
    └── mahabharata/
        └── bhisma-parva/
            └── bhagavad-gita/
                └── 02/
                    └── 13.mdx
No other content type may live here.

6. Canon Metadata Law (IDENTITY ONLY)
Every Canon file must include:
• cka_id• source_category• source_tradition• source_text• locator[] (ordered, lossless, tradition-aware)• language• script• authority_scope: "canon"
Optional Context (DESCRIPTIVE ONLY)
Allowed:
• speaker• listener• setting
Forbidden:
❌ meanings❌ intentions❌ theology❌ psychology❌ explanation❌ UI hints

7. Canon Body Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The body of a CKA file must contain:
• verbatim scripture only• in the original language• without interpretation• without JSX• without formatting emphasis
Explicit Prohibitions
Canon must never contain:
❌ translations❌ synonyms❌ glosses❌ anvaya❌ commentary❌ summaries❌ headings❌ pedagogy❌ guidance
Canon is source, not content.

8. Canon vs Lexical Meaning (STRUCTURAL LAW)
Lexical meaning is not Canon.
Therefore:
• Gloss atoms (cross-verse semantic range)• Synonym atoms (verse-specific padārtha)
are explicitly excluded from Canon.
They live in derived layers with declared authority:
Layer
authority_scope
Gloss
derived
Synonym
derived
Translation
derived
Commentary
derived
This preserves the traditional flow:
pāṭha → padārtha → anvaya → bhāṣya,encoded structurally — not informally.

9. Immutability Doctrine
Canon is immutable by law.
Enforced via:
• schema constraints• folder isolation• validator scripts• dependency graph checks• governance rules
Any Canon change requires:
• explicit declaration• documented rationale• versioned approval
Silence ≠ consent.

10. Supremacy Rule
If any derived layer conflicts with Canon:
→ Canon prevails
If any automation conflicts with Canon:
→ Automation must fail
If any UI obscures Canon:
→ UI must change
Canon is the final reference, not the loudest voice.

11. Automation Subordination Law
Automation is a gatekeeper, never an author.
Automation MAY:
• scaffold files• validate schemas• enforce authority boundaries• detect violations
Automation MAY NOT:
❌ invent doctrine❌ harmonize scripture❌ interpret verses❌ generate guidance❌ act as guru
AI is a scribe, never a teacher.

12. Constitutional Priority
If any document, schema, component, script, or practiceconflicts with this doctrine:
👉 VKAD-01 prevails.
