Project: Vedic SkillsRoadmap Version: 1.0 (Authoritative)Starting Point: Post-Phase 12B (Authority-Aware Disclosure Complete)Goal: Canon-perfect, tradition-safe, user-usable, future-proof system

ROADMAP PHILOSOPHY (READ THIS FIRST)
This roadmap is not feature-driven.It is authority-driven.
Every phase answers one question only:
“Does this make the system more truthful without increasing doctrinal risk?”
If the answer is “no”, it does not ship.

PHASE 0 — FOUNDATIONAL FREEZE ❄️ (COMPLETED)
Status: DONERelevant VKAD: 01–06, 10, 13, 17
What is frozen forever
	•	Canon immutability
	•	Authority stack (Levels 0–9 + Sampradāya)
	•	Canon schema & locator model
	•	Lexical law (Gloss ≠ Synonym)
	•	Commentary separation
	•	authority_scope law
	•	Validators as gatekeepers
	•	Automation as scribe, not teacher
👉 No roadmap item re-opens this phase.

PHASE 1 — CANON EXPANSION (SAFE GROWTH) 🟢
VKAD: 01, 02, 03, 04Risk: LowGoal: Populate canon, not reinterpret it
Objectives
	1	Add more canonical verses safely
	2	Expand Śruti, Smṛti, Itihāsa, Purāṇa, Āgama, Vedāṅga, Upaveda, Darśana
	3	Maintain one-atom-per-unit discipline
Allowed Actions
	•	Add new .mdx CKAs
	•	Fill canonical trees already created
	•	Extend Bhagavad-gītā chapters
	•	Add other texts (Upaniṣads, etc.)
Forbidden
	•	No translations inside canon
	•	No UI hints
	•	No interpretive metadata
✅ This phase can continue indefinitely in parallel with others.

PHASE 2 — LEXICAL & TRANSLATION DENSIFICATION 🟢
VKAD: 05, 06Risk: LowGoal: Restore traditional pāṭha → padārtha → anvaya pipeline
Objectives
	•	Complete synonyms for all canonical verses
	•	Add multiple translations per verse
	•	Add gloss expansion across corpora
Key Rules
	•	Synonyms are verse-specific
	•	Glosses are cross-verse
	•	Translations never override canon
	•	All must declare authority_scope
This phase unlocks deep reading without doctrine risk.

PHASE 3 — COMMENTARY LAYER GROWTH 🟡
VKAD: 06, 07Risk: MediumGoal: Preserve ācārya voices without collapse into doctrine
Objectives
	•	Add commentary sources (Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva, Gauḍīya, etc.)
	•	Add translations of commentary
	•	Maintain commentator identity strictly
Safety Controls
	•	Commentary always references canon
	•	Commentary never references guidance
	•	Cross-commentary references are discouraged
	•	Sampradāya disclosure required
🟡 Proceed slowly; validators already protect you.

PHASE 4 — PRINCIPLES & SKILLS ACCRETION 🟡
VKAD: 08, 09Risk: MediumGoal: Abstract without prescribing
Objectives
	•	Derive more Principles from verses
	•	Link principles → skills carefully
	•	Ensure every abstraction cites CKAs
Non-Negotiables
	•	No techniques
	•	No advice
	•	No “should do”
	•	No psychological claims
Principles answer “what is true”, not “what to do”.

PHASE 5 — GUIDANCE (HIGHEST RISK LAYER) 🟡
VKAD: 10, 11Risk: HighGoal: Provide support without authority replacement
Objectives
	•	Expand contextual guidance cases
	•	Introduce more life scenarios
	•	Maintain reversibility & non-prescription
Mandatory Safeguards
	•	Always cite skills & principles
	•	Never cite canon directly
	•	Never claim universality
	•	Never diagnose
	•	Never command
Guidance must feel optional and humane, not doctrinal.

PHASE 6 — SAMPRADĀYA DEEPENING 🟢
VKAD: 12, 14Risk: Low (already protected)
Objectives
	•	Populate Gauḍīya texts further
	•	Add other sampradāyas later (Śrī, Mādhva, etc.)
	•	Enable comparative viewing (read-only)
Key Law
Sampradāya interprets canon —it never becomes canon.

PHASE 7 — COMPILATIONS (THEMATIC SYNTHESIS) 🟢
VKAD: 15Risk: Low
Objectives
	•	Create topic-based collections
	•	Aggregate verses, principles, skills
	•	No new meaning introduced
Compilations are indexes, not arguments.

PHASE 8 — COURSES (PEDAGOGICAL SEQUENCES) 🟡
VKAD: 15, 16Risk: Medium
Objectives
	•	Create learning paths
	•	Sequence atoms without altering authority
	•	Make learning human-friendly
Courses may order, but never reinterpret.

PHASE 9 — COMMUNITY (SOCIAL LAYER) 🔴
VKAD: 16, 17Risk: Very HighStatus: Deferred by default
When to attempt
Only after:
	•	Content density is high
	•	Moderation rules are clear
	•	Governance automation exists
Community must never generate doctrine.

PHASE 10 — SEARCH, DISCLOSURE & UX 🟢
VKAD: 17Risk: Low
Objectives
	•	Authority-aware search
	•	Disclosure-based UI
	•	Perspective toggles (canon / sampradāya / translation)
UX must reveal structure, not hide it.

PHASE 11 — EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS 🔴
Risk: HighOptional
	•	APIs
	•	Exports
	•	Read-only datasets
No integration may bypass validators.

FINAL STATE — PROJECT COMPLETION
The project is complete when:
✔ Canon is vast and stable✔ Derived layers are dense but bounded✔ Multiple traditions coexist safely✔ Guidance is humane, not prescriptive✔ Users can study deeply without distortion✔ Automation enforces doctrine silently✔ No single actor (human or AI) has authority
At that point, Vedic Skills is no longer a “project”.
It is infrastructure for truth-preserving study.

FINAL NOTE (IMPORTANT)
This roadmap is deliberately conservative.
Speed is not a virtue here.Accuracy is.
You are building something that should still be correct 50 years from now.
