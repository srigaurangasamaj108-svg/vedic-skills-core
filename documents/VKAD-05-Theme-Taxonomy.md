# VKAD-05: THEME, TAXONOMY & CONCEPTUAL CLASSIFICATION DOCTRINE  
_Vedic Knowledge Architecture Doctrine_

---

## 0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This doctrine defines **how meaning is classified without distortion**.

It governs:
• themes  
• taxonomies  
• concepts  
• lenses  
• overlays  

Its goal is to allow:
• deep discovery  
• precise filtering  
• contextual relevance  

— **without** turning śāstra into a tag soup or ideological grid.

If taxonomy becomes more visible than scripture, the system has failed.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (UNBREAKABLE)

> **Themes describe scripture; they do not define it.**

Themes are **secondary lenses**, never primary truth.

Canon exists **without themes**.  
Themes exist **because canon exists**.

---

## 2. TAXONOMY VS CONCEPT VS ENTITY (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

This platform distinguishes three fundamentally different things.

### 2.1 Taxonomy (Controlled Vocabulary)

Taxonomies are:
• finite  
• curated  
• slow-changing  

They exist to:
• enable filtering  
• prevent chaos  
• enforce consistency  

Examples:
• puruṣārtha  
• yoga-path  
• darśana  
• life-stage  

---

### 2.2 Concepts (Knowledge Graph Entities)

Concepts are:
• open-ended  
• definable  
• interlinked  

Examples:
• dharma  
• karma  
• vairāgya  
• saṁsāra  

Concepts live in:

src/content/entities/concepts/
They are **nodes**, not tags.

---

### 2.3 Themes (Editorial Assignments)

Themes are:
• applied by editors  
• contextual  
• revisable  

Themes never override:
• canon  
• structure  
• tradition  

---

## 3. THE THREE TAXONOMY TIERS (LOCKED MODEL)

All classification operates under **three tiers**.

---

### 3.1 Tier 1 — Identity Taxonomies (Mandatory)

These define **what the content is**.

Required for all scripture atoms.

Examples:
• canon_type (śruti, smṛti, itihāsa…)  
• text identity  
• structural unit (chapter, verse, kāṇḍa…)  

These are **not themes**.

---

### 3.2 Tier 2 — Primary Lenses (Consciously Chosen)

These describe **how the content may be approached**.

Examples:
• puruṣārtha (dharma / artha / kāma / mokṣa)  
• yoga-path (bhakti / jñāna / karma / dhyāna)  
• tradition (gaudīya, advaita, śaiva…)  

Rules:
• limited in number  
• explicitly declared  
• never inferred silently  

---

### 3.3 Tier 3 — Contextual Overlays (Optional)

These describe **where or for whom the content may resonate**.

Examples:
• life-stage  
• emotional context  
• usage context (study, contemplation, teaching)  

Overlays:
• may change over time  
• may be user-specific  
• are never universal  

---

## 4. PURUṢĀRTHA CLASSIFICATION (SPECIAL HANDLING)

Puruṣārtha is **foundational**, but dangerous if misused.

Rules:

• Every verse **may** relate to multiple puruṣārthas  
• Editors must choose **at most two**  
• If uncertain, leave unassigned  

Never force classification.

Silence is preferable to distortion.

---

## 5. LIFE-STAGE & GENDER OVERLAYS (SAFETY RULES)

Life-stage tagging exists to:
• prevent misapplication  
• enhance relevance  

Rules:
• life-stage tags are **guidance-biased**, not canonical  
• they must never appear as primary navigation on scripture pages  
• they must always be presented as “may be relevant for”  

Gender-specific overlays:
• must be explicitly contextual  
• must never imply exclusion  
• must be framed as responsibility, not identity  

---

## 6. DARŚANA & TRADITION AXIS

Darśana and sampradāya:

• apply primarily to commentary  
• secondarily to purport  
• rarely to verses themselves  

A verse does not “belong” to a darśana.  
A **reading** does.

---

## 7. THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ROLE

Taxonomies do **not** connect content to content.

Entities do.

Example:
• Verse → concept(dharma)  
• Concept → many verses  
• Courses & guidance reference the same concept node  

This prevents:
• duplication  
• drift  
• inconsistent definitions  

---

## 8. THEME ASSIGNMENT ETHICS

Editors must follow:

• humility  
• restraint  
• traceability  

Every theme assignment must be:
• justifiable  
• revisable  
• attributable  

Anonymous or automated theme assignment is forbidden.

---

## 9. SEARCH & VISIBILITY RULES

Search prioritization:

1. Canonical structure  
2. Textual identity  
3. Concept relationships  
4. Primary lenses  
5. Contextual overlays  

Themes never outrank verses.

---

## 10. FAILURE MODES THIS DOCTRINE PREVENTS

This doctrine explicitly prevents:

• theme-driven scripture distortion  
• ideological filtering  
• modern moral grids imposed on canon  
• infinite tag sprawl  
• AI-generated meaning layers  

---

## 11. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> **Taxonomy must clarify meaning —  
not compete with it.**

When themes become louder than śāstra,
classification has become corruption.
