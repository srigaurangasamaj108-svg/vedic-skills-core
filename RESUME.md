## How to Resume Work on *Vedic Skills*

This project is **constitution-governed** and **authority-sensitive**.  
Any new chat, contributor, or AI session **must re-anchor authority before acting**.

Failure to do so invalidates all work.

---

## 1. Mandatory Handoff Documents (READ IN ORDER)

These documents together form the **complete handoff set**:

1. **PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md**  
   → Non-negotiable laws of authority, canon, atomization, automation, and governance.

2. **ARCHITECTURE.md**  
   → System design, layer separation, schemas, validators, and read-only infrastructure.

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md**  
   → Phase status, frozen work, active validators, and future scope.

4. **PROJECT_STATUS.md**  
   → Ground truth of what exists *today* in the repository.

If anything you propose conflicts with these documents, **your proposal is invalid**.

---

## 2. Canonical Mental Model (Must Be Preserved)

> *Vedic Skills is a doctrine-preserving knowledge system where Canon is immutable, authority is explicit, interpretation is layered, automation is subordinate, and no higher layer may override a lower one.*

If you cannot restate this accurately, **do not proceed**.

---

## 3. Authority Stack (Locked)

LEVEL 0 — Canon (CKA)  
LEVEL 1 — Gloss / Concept  
LEVEL 2 — Entity  
LEVEL 3A — Synonym  
LEVEL 3B — Translation / Commentary  
LEVEL 4 — Principle  
LEVEL 5 — Skill  
LEVEL 6 — Guidance  
LEVEL 7 — Compilation  
LEVEL 8 — Course  
LEVEL 9 — Community  

Each level:
- depends only downward
- never rewrites lower authority
- declares `authority_scope` explicitly

---

## 4. Before Making Any Change, Ask

1. Which **authority layer** am I touching?
2. Does this introduce **interpretation where it is forbidden**?
3. Does this require a **schema or validator update**?

If unsure → **stop and clarify first**.

---

## 5. Actions Allowed Without Discussion

You may safely:

- Add new **Canonical Knowledge Atoms** (VKAD-01 compliant)
- Add derived atoms with correct `authority_scope`
- Improve validators to enforce existing doctrine
- Improve documentation without changing rules

---

## 6. Actions That Require Explicit Alignment

Do **not** proceed without discussion if you plan to:

- Modify Canon schema or hierarchy
- Change authority ordering or disclosure rules
- Mix sampradāya with scripture
- Let automation infer doctrine
- Place interpretation in LEVEL-0 or LEVEL-1

---

## 7. Required Opening Prompt for New Chats

When resuming in a new chat, begin with:

> “This is a continuation of the *Vedic Skills* project.  
> PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md, and PROJECT_STATUS.md are binding.  
> Authority rules are locked. Ask before proposing structural changes.”

---

## 8. Final Rule

> **Canon is source.  
> Everything else is service.**

If a feature, shortcut, or AI behavior threatens that principle:

👉 the feature is wrong.
